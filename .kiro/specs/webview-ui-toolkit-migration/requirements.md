# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VS Code Webview UI Toolkit will be deprecated on January 1, 2025. This feature involves migrating the TLA+ VS Code extension's webview components from the deprecated `@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit` to the recommended alternative `@vscode-elements/elements`. The migration needs to maintain all existing functionality while ensuring compatibility with future VS Code versions and improving the overall user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a TLA+ extension user, I want the webview panels to continue working after the toolkit deprecation, so that I can still access model checking results, coverage visualization, and proof step information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is updated THEN all existing webview functionality SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN users interact with model checking results THEN the check result view SHALL display correctly with all current features
3. WHEN users view coverage statistics THEN the coverage visualization SHALL work identically to the current implementation
4. WHEN users examine proof steps THEN the current proof step panel SHALL function without any regression

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a TLA+ extension developer, I want to replace the deprecated UI toolkit with a supported alternative, so that the extension remains maintainable and compatible with future VS Code versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the `@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit` dependency SHALL be completely removed
2. WHEN the new toolkit is integrated THEN `@vscode-elements/elements` SHALL be used for all UI components
3. WHEN building the extension THEN there SHALL be no deprecation warnings related to the webview toolkit
4. WHEN the extension loads THEN all webview components SHALL use the new toolkit components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a TLA+ extension user, I want the visual appearance and behavior of webview panels to remain consistent, so that my workflow is not disrupted by the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the check result panel THEN the layout and styling SHALL match the current design
2. WHEN interacting with data grids THEN sorting, filtering, and navigation SHALL work identically
3. WHEN using buttons and links THEN the click behavior and visual feedback SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN panels are resized or scrolled THEN the responsive behavior SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TLA+ extension developer, I want comprehensive component mapping documentation, so that future maintenance and updates can be performed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN a mapping document SHALL exist showing old vs new components
2. WHEN developers need to modify webview code THEN clear examples SHALL be available for each component type
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the migration process SHALL be documented with common pitfalls
4. IF new components have different APIs THEN adapter patterns SHALL be documented and implemented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a TLA+ extension user, I want the extension to be compatible with current and future VS Code versions, so that I can continue using it without version conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code is updated THEN the extension SHALL continue to function without compatibility issues
2. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL work with VS Code versions 1.95.0 and higher
3. WHEN webview panels are opened THEN they SHALL render correctly in all supported VS Code themes
4. IF VS Code introduces webview API changes THEN the extension SHALL remain compatible through the new toolkit

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a TLA+ extension developer, I want automated tests to verify the migration, so that I can ensure no functionality is broken during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN all existing webview functionality SHALL be verified to work correctly
2. WHEN component interactions are tested THEN user workflows SHALL be validated end-to-end
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN integration tests SHALL confirm proper toolkit integration
4. IF any component fails THEN the test suite SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

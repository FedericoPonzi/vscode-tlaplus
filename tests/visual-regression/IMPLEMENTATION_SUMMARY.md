   - Summary statistics (passed/failed/total)
   - Expandable details for each test case
   - Integration with test artifacts

4. **Utility Functions**
   - Screenshot file management (copy, cleanup, summary)
   - Directory structure management
   - File size and metadata analysis
   - Batch operations support

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Playwright Over Puppeteer**

   - Separate configuration, utilities, and test files
   - Reusable components for future expansion
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy maintenance and updates

3. **Configuration-Driven Testing**
   - Declarative test scenario definitions
   - Easy addition of new test cases
   - Consistent test data management
   - Flexible comparison settings

### Code Quality Measures

1. **TypeScript Implementation**
   - Full type safety for all components
   - Interface definitions for all data structures
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - IDE support and autocompletion

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation for missing files
   - Detailed error messages for debugging
   - Proper resource cleanup (browser instances)
   - Timeout handling for network operations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient screenshot capture process
   - Minimal memory footprint
   - Parallel test execution support
   - Optimized file operations

## Integration Points
